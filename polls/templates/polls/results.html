{% comment %}  still cannot figure out if my problem is coming from here or from views or urls. Before the last changes I was having some GET issues, but now I seem to still be having some POST issues dealing with the results page. {% endcomment %}
{% comment %} I have corrected it back from a POST issue back to a GET issue, but I am still unsure as to why it is not working. I have a feeling it has an issue with this results.html template, but Idk. {% endcomment %}
